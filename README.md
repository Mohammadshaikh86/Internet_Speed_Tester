# Internet Speed Test with ISP Details and Graph

## Overview
This Python project allows users to test their internet speed, fetch ISP details, and visualize speed trends using a graphical representation. The application provides real-time insights into download and upload speeds, making it a useful tool for monitoring internet performance.

## Features
- Measure **Download Speed** and **Upload Speed** using `speedtest-cli`
- Fetch **ISP Details** such as provider name and IP address using `requests`
- Display results in a **graphical representation** using `matplotlib`
- Simple and interactive UI using `tkinter`

## Prerequisites
